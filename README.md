##Professional Self-Assessment
As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I recognize the significant growth and development I have experienced both personally and professionally. My academic pursuits and practical projects have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the fast-paced and ever-evolving field of technology.
Beginning my studies in 2020, I have spent the past 4 years immersed in computer science, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the field's theoretical and practical aspects. Throughout this program, I have delved into various subjects, including software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management. Each course has contributed to building a solid foundation in programming, problem-solving, and analytical thinking.
My coursework and projects have provided me with hands-on experience in multiple programming languages and development environments. I have become proficient in languages such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, Python, and SQL, and have developed a strong grasp of software development methodologies, including Agile and DevOps. These skills have enabled me to design, develop, and optimize complex software systems that are both efficient and maintainable.
