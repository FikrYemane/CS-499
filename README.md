## Professional Self-Assessment
As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I recognize the significant growth and development I have experienced both personally and professionally. My academic pursuits and practical projects have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the fast-paced and ever-evolving field of technology.
Beginning my studies in 2020, I have spent the past 4 years immersed in computer science, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the field's theoretical and practical aspects. Throughout this program, I have delved into various subjects, including software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management. Each course has contributed to building a solid foundation in programming, problem-solving, and analytical thinking.
My coursework and projects have provided me with hands-on experience in multiple programming languages and development environments. I have become proficient in languages such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, Python, and SQL, and have developed a strong grasp of software development methodologies, including Agile and DevOps. These skills have enabled me to design, develop, and optimize complex software systems that are both efficient and maintainable.

## Software Design and Engineering: Atrifact 1 Fitness Tracking App
For the software engineering and design category, I have selected my fitness tracking app developed for the CS 360 course as the artifact. This app serves as a practical example of my skills in designing and implementing a complete software solution. To enhance my fitness tracking app in alignment with software engineering and design principles, I plan to focus on improving security, user-friendliness, and memory efficiency. For security, I will integrate new authentication for robust user authentication, ensuring that user data is protected by industry-standard protocols.

### List of Enhancements made
1. Comment Description of all files, It explains what the class and the functions in the class do
2. Changed the UI for the entire app, Making it easier for users to navigate
3. Weight entries are displayed with the current date, ensuring relevant and up-to-date information.
4. The AddWeight.java class is optimized for user experience by providing quick feedback and efficiently managing database interactions.
5. Inserting a new goal into the database is a constant-time operation.
6. Proper error handling and validation ensure that only valid data is processed, reducing the risk of application errors.
7. LoginActivity.java class activity efficiently handles user input and provides immediate feedback
