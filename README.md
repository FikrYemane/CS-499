## Professional Self-Assessment
As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I recognize the significant growth and development I have experienced both personally and professionally. My academic pursuits and practical projects have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the fast-paced and ever-evolving field of technology.
Beginning my studies in 2020, I have spent the past 4 years immersed in computer science, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the field's theoretical and practical aspects. Throughout this program, I have delved into various subjects, including software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management. Each course has contributed to building a solid foundation in programming, problem-solving, and analytical thinking.
My coursework and projects have provided me with hands-on experience in multiple programming languages and development environments. I have become proficient in languages such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, Python, and SQL, and have developed a strong grasp of software development methodologies, including Agile and DevOps. These skills have enabled me to design, develop, and optimize complex software systems that are both efficient and maintainable.

## Software Design and Engineering: Atrifact 1 Fitness Tracking App
For the software engineering and design category, I have selected my fitness tracking app developed for the CS 360 course as the artifact. This app serves as a practical example of my skills in designing and implementing a complete software solution. To enhance my fitness tracking app in alignment with software engineering and design principles, I plan to focus on improving security, user-friendliness, and memory efficiency. For security, I will integrate new authentication for robust user authentication, ensuring that user data is protected by industry-standard protocols.

### List of Enhancements made
1. Comment Description of all files, It explains what the class and the functions in the class do
2. Changed the UI for the entire app, Making it easier for users to navigate
3. Weight entries are displayed with the current date, ensuring relevant and up-to-date information.
4. The AddWeight.java class is optimized for user experience by providing quick feedback and efficiently managing database interactions.
5. Inserting a new goal into the database is a constant-time operation.
6. Proper error handling and validation ensure that only valid data is processed, reducing the risk of application errors.
7. LoginActivity.java class activity efficiently handles user input and provides immediate feedback.
8. Removed any unused or redundant code and variables.
9. Better Secuirty for the userLogin. 
In my fitness tracking app artifact, I’ve focused on several enhancements that contribute to building a more collaborative and effective development environment. Throughout the code, extensive commenting is an essential component. I improve the accessibility of the codebase for all project participants by clearly outlining the functions and classes. This is especially crucial in cooperative settings where several developers are collaborating. Well-commented code ensures that everyone on the team can immediately understand the purpose and operation of various app functions, lowering the learning curve for others and preventing misunderstandings.
I've also given user experience and security top priority. Strong user authentication must be integrated in order to safeguard user information and foster user trust. In collaborative environments, where users depend on the app to handle and keep sensitive data, this security precaution is essential. I contribute to a more dependable and safe environment where users feel comfortable sharing and accessing information, which is essential for productive collaboration, by making sure that data is safeguarded by industry-standard standards.
To improve user experience and performance, I've improved the AddWeight.java code, making sure that data entries are current and pertinent. For users to receive trustworthy information that they can rely on when making decisions, effective data processing and error management are essential. These updates not only improve the operation of the app but also foster a more effective and fruitful collaboration atmosphere by providing quick access to accurate and relevant information.




## Algorithms and Data Structure: Artifact 2 OpenGl 3d Render
My OpenGL object for my artifact falls under the algorithms and data structures category. It was part of the computer graphics and visual computing course I took, CS-330. The artifact is a component of a project in which we developed a 3D scene manager that uses OpenGL to manage the rendering of different objects, textures, and materials. The main objective of the project was to manage resources including textures, shaders, and geometric data while implementing effective rendering algorithms. Because it demonstrates the application of sophisticated data structures—such as maps for quick lookups and algorithms for resource management and rendering optimization—this artifact is very pertinent.

### Enhancements
- Memory Management: improve memory safety, reduce the risk of memory leaks, and ensure proper resource deallocation.
- Rendering Performance: Optimized the rendering algorithms by reducing redundant state changes and minimizing OpenGL calls, resulting in a smoother and faster rendering process.
- Texture Loading: Applied efficient image processing techniques and minimized redundant texture binding to reduce the overhead of texture operations.
- Removed any unused library imports, functions, and codes.
- Added detailed analysis for key methods with specific time complexity
- Made sure i had an efficient memory deallocation using the DestroyGLTextures function.
- Made LoadSceneTextures function loads textures only once and binds them, minimizing the overhead of loading textures during runtime.
- Better Error handling is included to notify the user if any texture fails to load, which is essential for debugging and ensuring rendering consistency.
- Added the ApplyTransformations function to efficiently compose multiple transformations into a single operation, which reduces the overhead of applying transformations individually.

## Databases: Artifact 1 Fitness Tracking App
As a project for my CS 360 course, which concentrated on using database management methods and principles, I created the fitness tracking app. The main objective was to develop a system that could manage user data about fitness-related activities, such as tracking progress over time, keeping track of workouts, and offering data visualization insights. The database architecture of the program, which maintains user profiles, activity logs, and goal accomplishments, is essential to its operation.
